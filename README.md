# Tree Cutting Reporter

This is an app for recruitment purposes. I had 8 hours to write it (crazy saturday :D). I got a API `https://api-pwd.housecode.pl/swagger-ui.html` and tasks:
- Log in 2 type of users: admin/user
- List of users only in admin panel view
- Edit Users
- Create new point of tree cutting
- List all tree cutting points
- Edit tree cutting point

# Run the project

`npm install` and `npm start`

# What I did, what I did't 

- Log in 2 type of users: admin/user used JWT- Done
- List of users only in admin panel view - Done
- Edit Users - Done (Only in Admin Panel)
- Create new point tree cutting - Done, but the API needs super exact GPS number, so it's difficult to add point
- List all tree cutting points - Done
- Edit tree cutting point - No
- Design - Done
- Super shine, extra animation and eye-catching design - No :<

# Potencial feature 

- AuthGuardians for frontend route authorisation
- Better info about errors
- Register new users
- Make users able to edit his data
